# Design and Development Principles

0.
Always use --legacy-peer-deps
"bundleIdentifier": "co.girgin.aiapp"
my organization nane = co.girgin



## 1. Expo Compatibility
- Use packages that have proper Expo support
- Ensure all implementations work within Expo's framework
- Test compatibility before implementing new features

## 2. Design Consistency
- No shadows in design
- No gradients unless specifically requested
- Maintain consistent styling across all routes:
  - Analysis page
  - Editor page
  - History page
- Use consistent color palette:
  - Primary (Green): #58cc02 / #58a700
  - Secondary (Blue): #1cb0f6 / #1899d6
  - Text (Dark): #4b4b4b
  - Text (Light): #777777
  - Border: #e5e5e5

## 3. Button Design (DuoButton)
- Follow Duolingo's button animation style
- Use bottom border only (no full border)
- Fast, snappy animations:
  - Spring configuration:
    - tension: 400
    - friction: 20
- Consistent appearance when disabled:
  - No opacity changes
  - Maintain visual style
  - Only disable interactivity

## 4. UI Principles
- Keep UI clean and minimal
- Show loading states for async operations
- Maintain proper spacing and alignment
- Make interfaces intuitive and user-friendly
- Use consistent component sizing:
  - Button height: 50px
  - Input padding: 16px
  - Border radius: 12px
  - Border width: 2px

## 5. Code Organization
- Keep code clean and well-structured
- Maintain consistent styling patterns
- Proper error handling:
  - Clear error messages
  - Graceful fallbacks
  - User-friendly error states
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - Component logic
  - Styling
  - Business logic
  - API calls

## 6. User Experience
- Immediate feedback for user actions
- Clear loading states
- Intuitive navigation
- Consistent behavior across the app
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Proper keyboard handling
- Safe area awareness

## 7. Performance
- Fast loading times
- Smooth animations
- Efficient state management
- Proper async operation handling
- Minimize unnecessary rerenders

These principles should be followed across all features and components in the application to maintain consistency and quality.
